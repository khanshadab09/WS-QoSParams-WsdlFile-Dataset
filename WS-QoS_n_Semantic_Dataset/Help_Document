*************************************Description*************************************

The dataset provides a comprehensive integration of QoS metrics and the associated semantic description in OWLS language of the Web Services.
The generated semantic descriptions are available in both a Natural Language format and the machine-readable SWRL/KIF format.
The research utilized QWS (Dataset-1) and WS-DREAM (Dataset-2), which were deemed most appropriate due to their provision of comprehensive, verified QoS metadata and corresponding WSDL URIs.

1. QWS (Dataset-1): It contains details of 2507 WS out of which Semantic description of 169 WS are successfully generated in NL and SWRL/KIF format respectively.
2. WS-DREAM (Dataset-2): It contains details of 5825 WS out of which 286 WS are successfully generated in NL and SWRL/KIF format respectively.
